<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/runaway-carriage.jpg" -->

Note:

Describe that it's the part on a typewriter that moved the paper back and forth. Line feed would move down to the next line.

You could just carriage return without line feed and overwrite text.

### Building a progress bar
```go
func drawBar(percent int) {
    cols := 10
    prog := strings.Repeat("=", cols*percent/100.0)
    fmt.Printf("\rdemo progress: %3[1]d%% |%-[3]*[2]s|",
        percent, prog, cols)
}
```

### Building a progress bar (con't)
