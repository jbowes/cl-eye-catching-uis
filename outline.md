# Introduction

## What this session is about

## Who I am

## An appetizer

## Just how bad things can go

# How can we tell what is supported?

## Env vars
## terminfo
## Rely on the user :(

# Handling Windows

## At least there's only one odd one out now!

# Main

## Displaying color and text formatting
## Building a single-line updating progress bar/spinner
## Detecting terminal size for columnar output and text wrapping
## Multi-line interactive inline inputs
## Cursor movement and input masking
## Fullscreen interfaces
## Displaying graphics in terminals that support it
## Capturing mouse input

# Closing

## Next steps

### Libraries that make it easy
### Graceful degradation

## thank you!
